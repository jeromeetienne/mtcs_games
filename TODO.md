# TODO
- in game_protocol, add a .copy() method to clone a game state
- make the move an actual type
  - currently it's just an int
- try to make it play chess too
  - how would that work with MTCS ?
- how to get the move representation for chess ?
  - e.g. uci
- Do a better UI
  - color in the output
  - make it possible to select the legal moves by arrow keys
