# mtcs games
This repository contains implementations of various two-player games using the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm. The games included are:
- Tic-Tac-Toe
- Connect4
- Othello

Each game is implemented with a common interface defined in the `protocols` module, allowing for easy integration with different player strategies, including human players and AI players using MCTS.

The UI is console-based, providing a simple way to interact with the games. Players can choose to play as 'X' or 'O' and can select which game to play via command-line arguments.

MTCS doesn't need to know the rules of the game, it just needs to be able to simulate games and get the result. 
No heuristics are used, just pure random simulations.
MTCS is implemented in the `players` module, with a dedicated class for the MCTS player.

## Games

### Tic-Tac-Toe
A simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game.

### Connect4
A Connect4 game where players take turns dropping discs into a 7-column, 6-row vertically suspended grid.

### Othello
An implementation of the Othello game, also known as Reversi, played on an 8x8 board.

## How to install

Create a virtual environment and install the required packages:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## How to play
Run the `play_game.py` script with the desired game and player options:

```bash
./bin/play_game.py --game tictactoe --first human
```

```bash
./bin/play_game.py --game connect4 --first ai
```

To get the inline help, run:

```bash
» ./bin/play_game.py -h                                                                                                 1 ↵
usage: play_game.py [-h] [--game {tictactoe,connect4,othello}] [--first {human,ai,random}] [--second {human,ai,random}] [--simulations SIMULATIONS] [--exploration EXPLORATION]

Play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect4, or Othello against an AI.
